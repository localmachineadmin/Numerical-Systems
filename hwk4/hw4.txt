Create a multigrid solver (FMA) for the 3-D time-dependent heat equation
with source term using the Backward Euler (BE) discretization. It is understood
that you will closely follow the class code (adapted from NR) for the 2-D
steady state heat equation with source. A few changes will need to be made:
all routines will have to be changed from 2d to 3d; the relax, resid, and slvsml
routines will all have to be changed (very slightly) to solve the BE
matrix at a timestep. (50 pts)

Show a plot of performance results as a function of problem size vs. SOR for
problems of size 32^3, 64^3, 128^3 and 256^3 (if SOR is taking too
long don't bother waiting). To standardize the results, use 2 V cycles
and 2 pre and post sweeps for these tests. (20 pts)

Compare FMA vs. FMA for three different choices of relaxation scheme: Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel,
and Gauss-Seidel with Red-Black ordering. (10 pts each)

Possible extra credit points: 
 - use Crank Nicholson in addition to backward Euler. 
 - compare results for cubic interpolation vs. trilinear 
 - compare results for "direct injection" restriction (simply copy fine points
   to coarse at corresponding grid locations). Make sure you measure
   the error and compare run time to get to equivalent error level.
